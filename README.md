SolArk publishes no information about an API for the data going to the cloud from their inverters. So I managed to figure one out using information in the PowerView web app they provide their customers.  The data in that app is not real-time and has a granularity measured in minutes, but this is good enough for lots of automation needs, such as deciding when large loads should be turned off or on. The number of watts being collected from a panel is a good proxy for whether the sun is out or not, and that can be used to decide to turn on a pump for, say, hydronic hot water collection.  SunSynk uses very similar technology (and had even been using the same backend) so people with SunSynk inverters might also find this useful.  Eventually I hope to collect data directly from the inverter by gaining a better understanding of the protocol that the WiFi dongle uses, but this will do in the meantime.  I've already included this API in parts of my ESP8266-base Remote Control project.  See https://github.com/judasgutenberg/Esp8266_RemoteControl.
